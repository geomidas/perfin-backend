# PerFin

*Backstory:*
*I couldn't find any app that would allow me to track my finances they way I wanted so I've created a spreadsheet. I'm happily using it for more than a year and made my life easier. However it's too complex and non-intuitive for others to use.*
*This is a Webapp implementation of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGleyNnVNXcRlVOE7s3qTceqyuhsC7ikigGE_oeAlMo/edit?usp=sharing)*

*Personal Finance app that helps you...*
 - *Track your monthly salary*
 - *Plan your monthly money allocation*
 - *Track your monthly debt repayments*
 - *Track your investments*
 - *Track your assets and net worth*
 - *Plan long term strategy towards financial independence*
